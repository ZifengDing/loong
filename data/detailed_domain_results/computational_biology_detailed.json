    "question": "Determining tyrosine content of an unknown protein\n\nA previously unknown protein has been isolated in your laboratory. Others in your lab have determined that the protein sequence contains 172 amino acids. They have also determined that this protein has no tryptophan and no phenylalanine. You have been asked to determine the possible tyrosine content of this protein. You know from your study of this chapter that there is a relatively easy way to do this. You prepare a pure 50 µM solution of the protein, and you place it in a sample cell with a 1 cm path length, and you measure the absorbance of this sample at 280 nm in a UV-visible spectrophotometer. The absorbance of the solution is 0.372. Are there tyrosines in this protein? How many? (Hint: You will need to use Beer’s Law, which is described in any good general chemistry or physical chemistry textbook. You will also find it useful to know that the units of molar absorptivity are M⁻¹cm⁻¹.)",
    "final_answer": "Beer’s law relates the absorbance of a solution to the path length (l) solute concentration [C] and light-absorbing properties of the solute.\n\nFor a substance, the absorbance is defined as follows:\n\nA_λ = -log (I/I_0)\n\nWhere I_0 is the intensity of incident light and I is the intensity of light after it passes through the substance. The ratio of I to I_0 is the transmission, T. The subscript, λ, specifies the wavelength of light and is often the wavelength at which absorbance is maximum for the substance. Beer’s law is:\n\nA_λ = -log (I/I_0) = ε [C] l\n\nIn our case Beer’s law is being applied to a solution of protein. The term [C] refers to the concentration of light-absorbing compound in solution. We are told that the protein lacks phenylalanine and tryptophan so the only other amino acid that absorbs light at 280 nm is tyrosine*.\n\nWe are only interested in measuring the absorption of light due to the protein and not, for example to the cuvette or solvent used to dissolve the protein. To accomplish this the cuvette is first filled with solvent only and the instrument electronically zeroed. This, in effect, sets the transmitted light intensity for a cuvette filled with solvent-only equal to the incident light intensity. (The absorbance is zero when the transmission is one and this occurs when I = I_0.) The cuvette is then filled with the solution under consideration and the absorbance recorded. It is standard practice to use cuvettes with 1 cm path length. Thus, the magnitude of the absorbance recorded is linearly dependent on the concentration, [C], and on the molar absorptivity, ε.\n\nThe absorbance is given as 0.371. Using Beer’s Law we can determine the concentration provided we know the molar absorptivity. The molar absorptivity of tyrosine is 1,490 M⁻¹cm⁻¹.\n\nA_280 nm = 0.371 = ε [C] l\n\n[C] = 0.371 / (1,490 M⁻¹cm⁻¹ × 1 cm) = 2.49 × 10⁻⁴ M\n\nThe molar concentration calculated above is the concentration of the chromophore, namely tyrosine, in the protein solution, which is at 50 µM. If we assume that there are n moles of tyrosine per mole of protein then\n\nthe molarity of tyrosine is simply n × 50 µM. Equating these two and solving for n we find the number of tyrosines in the protein.\n\n2.49 × 10⁻⁴ M = n × 50 × 10⁻⁶ M\n\nn = (2.49 × 10⁻⁴ M) / (50 × 10⁻⁶ M) = 4.98 ≈ 5\n\n*The UV absorption spectra of proteins are determined by the aromatic amino acids and to a very small extent by cystine (essentially di-cysteine, two cysteines linked by a disulfide bond). Phenylanine does not absorb at 280 nm but tryptophan, tyrosine and cystine do. (See “How to measure and predict the molar absorption coefficient of a protein” by Pace, CN, Vajdos F, Fee L, Grimsley G and Gray T in Protein Science (1995) 4:2411-23.) The protein being studied was likely treated with a reducing agent, like dithiothreitol or β-mercaptoethanol to break disulfide bonds and so there should be no contribution to UV absorbance by cystine at 280 nm. Another problem that can arise when measuring light absorbing properties of proteins is that the absorptivity of the amino acids is influenced by the local environment in which the amino acid exists in the protein. Denaturing agents like 8 M urea or 6 M guanidinium HCl are often used in conjunction with a reducing agent to convert the protein into a so-called random coil whose UV-light absorbing properties more closely mimic those of its amino acid composition.",

Knowing that 0.505 g/ml = 100% saturation, or 1.00 saturation: S2 = (initial wt of AS present) + (wt AS added)/(final vol. of solution in ml)(0.505 g/ml) = (1000 ml)(0.505 g/ml)(S1) + (wt)/(1000 ml + 0.565(wt)) 0.505 g/ml wt = 505(S2 - S1)/(1 - 0.285S2) (17) Different sources give slightly different values.

What is the standard free energy change (ΔG'°), for the reduction of coenzyme Q by NADH as carried out by complex I (NADH:coenzyme Q reductase) of the electron transport pathway if E'°_{NAD/NADH+H^+} = -0.320 V and E'°_{CoQ/CoQH_2}= +0.060 V.\nb. What is the equilibrium constant (K_eq) for this reaction?\nc. Assume that (1) the actual free energy release accompanying the NADH-coenzyme Q reductase reaction is equal to the amount released under standard conditions (as calculated above), (2) this energy can be converted into the synthesis of ATP with an efficiency = α (75% of the energy released upon NADH oxidation is captured in ATP synthesis), and (3) the oxidation of 1 equivalent of NADH by coenzyme Q leads to the phosphorylation of 1 equivalent of ATP. Under these conditions, what is the maximum ratio of [ATP]/[ADP][P_i] attainable for oxidative phosphorylation when [P_i] = 1 mM (Assume ΔG'° for ATP synthesis = +30.5 kJ/mol.)",
    "final_answer": "Answer: a. The relevant half reactions are (from Table 3.5):\nNAD^+ + 2H^+ + 2e^- → NADH + H^+, E'° = -0.320\n\nCoQ (UQ) + 2H^+ + 2e^- → CoQH_2 (UQH_2), E'° = +0.060\n\nThus, CoQ is the electron acceptor and NADH is the electron donor.\n\nΔE_0' = E_0' (acceptor) - E_0' (donor) = E_0' (CoQ) - E_0' (NAD^+)\nΔE_0' = +0.060 - (-0.320) = +0.38 V\n\nThe free energy change for the reaction is given by:\nΔG° = -nF ΔE_0'\nwhere n is the number of electrons, and\nF = Faraday's constant = 96.485 kJ V^{-1} mol^{-1}.\n\nΔG° = -2 × 96.485 kJ V^{-1} mol^{-1} × (0.38 V) = -73.3 kJ mol^{-1}\n\nb.

A human liver cell contains two sets of 23 chromosomes, each set being roughly equivalent in information content. The total mass of DNA contained in these 46 enormous DNA molecules is 4 x 10^{12} daltons. Because each nucleotide pair contributes 660 daltons to the mass of DNA and 0.34 nm to the length of DNA, what is the total number of nucleotide pairs and the complete length of the DNA in a liver cell? How does this length compare with the overall dimensions of a liver cell?\n\nThe maximal information in each set of liver cell chromosomes should be related to the number of nucleotide pairs in the chromosome set’s DNA. This number can be obtained by dividing the total number of nucleotide pairs calculated above by 2. What is this value?\n\nIf this information is expressed in proteins that average 400 amino acids in length and three nucleotide pairs encode one amino acid in a protein, how many different kinds of proteins might a liver cell be able to produce? (In reality, livers cells express at most about 30,000 different proteins.

    "question": "Assessing the binding of a hormone to its receptor\n\nA typical hormone binds to its receptor with an affinity (\\(K_d\\)) of approximately \\(1 \\times 10^{-9}\\) M. Consider an in vitro (test-tube) system in which the total hormone concentration is approximately 1 nM and the total concentration of receptor sites is 0.1 nM. What fraction of the receptor sites is bound with hormone? If the concentration of receptors is decreased to 0.033 nM, what fraction of receptors is bound with the hormone?",
    "final_answer": "For simple equilibrium binding of hormone to receptor, the following equilibrium applies:\n\n\\[ [\\text{HR}] \\equiv [\\text{H}] + [\\text{R}] \\]\n\nWhere [HR], [H], and [R] refer to the concentrations of hormone receptor complex, free hormone (i.e., unbound hormone), and uncomplexed receptor. The equilibrium dissociation constant for this reaction is:\n\n\\[ K_d = \\frac{[\\text{H}][\\text{R}]}{[\\text{HR}]} \\]\n\nWe are given the total concentration of receptor sites. In the presence of hormone, total receptor partitions into free receptor, R, and HR. Thus, \\([\\text{R}_{\\text{total}}] = [\\text{R}] + [\\text{HR}]\\). The total hormone concentration is \\([\\text{H}_{\\text{total}}] = [\\text{H}] + [\\text{HR}]\\). We are asked to calculate the fraction of receptor sites bound so we keep driving for \\([\\text{found} = [\\text{HR}]/[\\text{R}_{\\text{total}}]\\) using these three equations. Using \\(K_d\\), we can write \\([\\text{HR}]\\) as a function of \\([\\text{R}_{\\text{total}}]\\) and \\([\\text{H}_{\\text{total}}]\\) as follows:\n\n\\[ K_d[\\text{HR}] = [\\text{H}][\\text{R}] \\]\n\n\\[ [\\text{H}] = [\\text{H}_{\\text{total}}] - [\\text{HR}]\\, \\text{and} \\, [\\text{R}] = [\\text{R}_{\\text{total}}] - [\\text{HR}] \\]\n\n\\[ K_d[\\text{HR}] = ([\\text{H}_{\\text{total}}] - [\\text{HR}])([\\text{R}_{\\text{total}}] - [\\text{HR}]) \\]\n\n\\[ [\\text{HR}]^2 - [\\text{HR}]([\\text{H}_{\\text{total}}] + [\\text{R}_{\\text{total}}] + K_d) + [\\text{H}_{\\text{total}}][\\text{R}_{\\text{total}}] = 0 \\]\n\nThe solution to this quadratic equation is:\n\n\\[ [\\text{HR}] = \\frac{[\\text{H}_{\\text{total}}] + [\\text{R}_{\\text{total}}] + K_d ± \\sqrt{([\\text{H}_{\\text{total}}]+[\\text{R}_{\\text{total}}]+K_d)^2 - 4[\\text{H}_{\\text{total}}][\\text{R}_{\\text{total}}]}}{2} \\]\n\nThe correct solution is the minus root. (When there are no hormones present, \\([\\text{HR}]\\) must be zero. For the above equation to equal to zero in this situation, the minus root must apply.)\n\nThe answers are \\([\\text{found}] = 0.488\\) at 0.1 nM receptor and \\([\\text{found}] = 0.496\\) at 0.033 nM receptor. This seems reasonable. The \\(K_d\\) is the concentration of free hormone that would half-saturate receptors. The free hormone concentration in both cases will be very close to 1 nM because the receptor concentrations are smaller than this number. If receptors were completely saturated, the free hormone concentration would be 1 nM – 0.1 nM or 1 nM – 0.033 nM, which are both close to 1 nM.",

    "question": "8. Understanding the structure and function of signal sequences and signal peptidases. The amino acid sequence deduced from the nucleotide sequence of a newly discovered human gene begins: MRSLILLVCLPLALAGK.... Is this a signal sequence? If so, where does the signal peptidase act on it? What can you surmise about the intended destination of this protein?",
    "final_answer": "A signal sequence is an amino-terminal sequence that contains the information necessary for the protein to be targeted to and transported into the lumen of the ER. Signal peptides are characterized by a sequence consisting of one or more basic residues followed by a stretch of 6 to 12 hydrophobic amino acids. Leader peptidases within the ER lumen removes the signal peptide at a position immediately following the motif A-X-A, with X representing any amino acid and allowing conservative substitutions of the alanine. In the sequence MRSLILLVCLPLALAGK..., a basic amino acid is found at position 2, which is followed immediately by a hydrophobic sequence of the length appropriate for a signal peptide. Thus, this sequence could function as a signal peptide, causing the passenger protein to be translocated into the ER lumen. The motif A-X-A is roughly met in the sequence A-L-G in this peptide, and so leader peptidase would be expected to cleave the signal sequence between the G and K. This protein may pass through the endomembrane system and ultimately be secreted.\n\nThere are Internet resources to analyze sequences for potential signal sequences. The Swissport database has a link to one of them in their “Tools” page at http://expasy.org/tools/. On that page locate SignalP and activate it. This should bring you to SignalP 3.0 Server page. I submitted the short sequence and got a result.\n\nthat suggested it contained a signal sequence. The sequence, however, seemed to be too short to analyze properly so I attached to its C-terminus a random protein sequence of 200 amino acid residues I generated at using a program at http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms/index.html. Analysis indicated that the N-terminal sequence was indeed a signal sequence with a potential cleavage site between G and K in the N-terminal sequence.",

Here is one possible answer.\n\nLet,\n\n\\[ f_A + f_G + f_C + f_T = 1.0 \\]\n\nwhere the terms are the mole fraction of each nucleotide.\n\n\\[ f_A + f_G + f_T + f_C = 1.0 \\]\n\nBut, \\( f_T = 1.04 \\, f_T \\) and \\( f_G = 1.0 \\, f_C \\) thus,\n\n\\[1.04 \\, f_T + 1.0 \\, f_C + f_T + f_C = 1.0, \\, \\text{or}\\]\n\\[2.04 \\, f_T + 2.0 \\, f_C = 1.0\\]\n\nBy substituting \\( f_T = 1.43 \\, f_C \\) we find that\n\n\\[2.04 \\times 1.43 \\, f_C + 2 \\, f_C = 1.0, \\, \\text{and}\\]\n\\[f_C = 0.20\\]\n\nAnd since\n\n\\[\\frac{G}{C} = 1.0, \\, f_G = 0.20\\]\n\n\\[ f_A = 1.29 f_G \\]\n\n\\[f_A = 1.29 \\times 0.20\\]\n\\[ f_A = 0.26 \\]\n\nAnd, finally since\n\n\\[\\frac{T}{C} = 1.43\\]\n\\[ f_C \\]\n\n\\[f_T = 1.43 \\times f_C = 1.43 \\times 0.20 = 0.29\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[f_A = 0.26, \\, f_C = 0.20, \\, f_G = 0.20, \\, f_T = 0.29\\]\n\nThese are consistent with some of the data but not all of it. Below are other solutions you might come up with that are consistent with some of the data but not all of it.\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{cccc}\nA & C & G & T \\\\\n0.30 & 0.23 & 0.23 & 0.33 \\\\\n0.29 & 0.20 & 0.20 & 0.28 \\\\\n0.29 & 0.20 & 0.20 & 0.28 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nBy treating the data as several equations in A, G, T and C one can come up with a solution that best fits all the data. Using \\( A/G = 1.29 \\), here is an example of one such equation:\n\n\\[ A - 1.29G + 0C + 0T = 0 \\]\n\nThe others are (from \\( T/C = 1.43, \\, A/T = 1.04, \\, A/G = 1, \\, A/G/C/T = 1.1 \\) and \\( A + T + C + G = 1 \\)):\n\n\\[0A + 0G - 1.43C + T = 0\\]\n\\[A + 0G + 0C + 1.04T = 0\\]\n\\[A - G + 0C + 0T = 0\\]\n\\[ A + 0 - 1.1C - 1.1 T = 0\\]\n\\[ A + G + C + T = 1.0\\]\n\nWe have six equations. What we want to do is find the best solutions for A, G, C and T that, when substituted into these equations, make them as consistent as possible. To do this we need to rearrange them such that they all are functions that equal zero. (The first five are already in this form. The fifth would be \\( A + G + C + T - 1 = 0 \\).)\n\nWe then square each, sum them and then find solutions for A, G, C and T that minimize the sum of the squares. (In effect, this is a form of a least squares solution.) (The solution can be obtained using matrix algebra.) The answer is A = .295, G = .223, C = .201 and T = .280.\n\nAs an overkill, it must be that since the input data were A, G, T and C, some of the relationships presented in Table 10.1 are not truly independent. For example, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines must have been calculated with A, G, C, and T as input. If we eliminate this relationship from the analysis the answer is A = .289, T = .286, G = .218 and C = .206.",

    "question": "Plot the titration curve for Bicene and calculate how to prepare a pH 7.5 Bicene buffer solution\nBicine (N, N-bis (2-hydroxyethyl) glycine) is another commonly used buffer in biochemistry labs. The structure of bicine in its fully protonated form is shown below:\n\n      CH₂CH₂OH\n       |\n  +HN—CH₂COOH\n       |\n      CH₂CH₂OH\n\na. Draw the titration curve for Bicine, assuming the \\( pK_a \\) for its free COOH group is 2.3 and the \\( pK_a \\) for its tertiary amino group is 8.3.\n\n![Titration Curve](#)\n*Description: A titration curve with pH on the y-axis and equivalence on the x-axis. The curve begins near pH 2, gradually increases to pH 8, and then steepens past pH 10, showing inflection points around the \\( pK_a\\) values.*\n\nb. Draw the structure of the fully deprotonated form (completely dissociated form) of bicine.\n\n    CH_2CH_2OH\n      |\n      N—CH_2COO^-\n      |\n    CH_2CH_2OH\n\nc. You have available a 0.1 M solution of Bicine at its isoelectric point (pH_i), 0.1 M solutions of HCl and NaOH, and ample distilled H2O. Describe the preparation of 1 L of 0.04 M Bicine buffer, pH 7.5.",
    "final_answer": "The volume of 0.1 M bicine needed is:\n\nx \\times 0.1 \\, \\text{M} = 0.04 \\, \\text{M}\n\n\\frac{1 \\, \\text{L}}{1 \\, \\text{L}} = 0.04 \\, \\text{M}\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\nx = \\frac{1 \\, \\text{L} \\times 0.04 \\, \\text{M}}{0.1 \\, \\text{M}} = 0.4 \\, \\text{L} = 400 \\, \\text{ml}\n\nThe isoelectric point of Bicine is simply the average of the two pK\\(_a\\)s.\n\n\\text{pI} = \\frac{\\text{pK}_{a_1} + \\text{pK}_{a_2}}{2}\n\n\\text{pI} = \\frac{2.3 + 8.3}{2} = 5.3\n\nAt this pH the carboxyl group is mainly unprotonated whereas the tertiary nitrogen is nearly fully protonated and thus the average charge is zero. Using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation we can calculate the ratio of protonated to unprotonated species for each group. For the carboxyl group:\n\n\\text{pH} = \\text{pK}_{\\text{COOH}} + \\log \\frac{[\\text{COO}^-]}{[\\text{COOH}]}\n\n\\left[\\frac{\\text{COO}^-}{\\text{COOH}}\\right] = 10^{(\\text{pH} - \\text{pK}_{\\text{COOH}})} = 10^{(5.3-2.3)}\n\n\\left[\\frac{\\text{COO}^-}{\\text{COOH}}\\right] = 10^{3} = 1000\n\nThis calculation shows that at pH 7.5 only approximately 0.1% is protonated. The calculation for the tertiary nitrogen of bicine is as follows:\n\n\\text{pH} = \\text{pK}_{a} + \\log \\frac{[\\text{N}]}{[\\text{NH}^+]}\n\n\\left[\\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{NH}^+}\\right] = 10^{(\\text{pH} - \\text{pK}_{a})} = 10^{(5.3-8.3)}\n\n\\left[\\frac{\\text{N}}{\\text{NH}^+}\\right] = 10^{-3} = 0.001\n\nWe should have anticipated this result, namely the ratios are inverse, because we are starting at a pH that is equidistant from each pK\\(_a\\).\n\nTo adjust the pH from 5.3 to 7.5 will require addition of NaOH. The exact amount is determined by application of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation to both groups to determine the ratio of protonated to unprotonated forms of both species. For the carboxyl group:\n\n\\text{pH} = \\text{pK}_{\\text{COOH}} + \\log \\frac{[\\text{COO}^-]}{[\\text{COOH}]}\n\n\\left[\\frac{\\text{COO}^-}{\\text{COOH}}\\right] = 10^{(\\text{pH} - \\text{pK}_{\\text{COOH}})} = 10^{(7.5-2.3)}\n\n\\left[\\frac{\\text{COO}^-}{\\text{COOH}}\\right] = 10^{5.2} = 1.58 \\times 10^{5}\n\nFor the amino group:\n\n\\text{pH} = \\text{pK}_\\text{a} + \\log \\left(\\frac{[\\text{N}]}{[\\text{NH}^+]} \\right)\n\n\\left[\\frac{[\\text{N}]}{[\\text{NH}^+]}\\right] = 10^{(\\text{pH}-\\text{pK}_\\text{a})} = 10^{(7.5-8.3)}\n\n\\left[\\frac{[\\text{N}]}{[\\text{NH}^+]}\\right] = 10^{-0.8} = 0.158\n\nUsing these equations and remembering that the total sum of COO- and COOH is equal to 0.04 mol (0.04 M times 1 L) and that the same is true for the protonated and unprotonated nitrogen, we can calculate the moles of each species at the starting pH (i.e., the pI) and at pH = 7.5. The results are shown to five places. The column labeled “delta” is the change in the species from pI to pH = 7.5.\n\n\\begin{array}{lccc}\n& \\text{pI = 5.3} & \\text{pH = 7.5} & \\text{delta} \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{COO-} & 0.03996 & 0.04000 & -0.00004 \\\\\n\\text{COOH} & 0.00004 & 0.00000 & 0.00004 \\\\\n\\text{N} & 0.00004 & 0.00546 & -0.00542 \\\\\n\\text{NH}^+ & 0.03996 & 0.03454 & 0.00542 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Sum} & & & 0.00546 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\nUsing 0.1 M NaOH we need 54.6 ml. The final solution is then adjusted to a final volume of 1L with 545.4 ml of water.",

    "question": "Chargaff’s results (Table 10.1) yielded a molar ratio of 1.29 for A to G in ox DNA, 1.43 for T to C, 1.04 for A to T, and 1.00 for G to C. Given these values, what are the mole fractions of A, C, G, and T in ox DNA?",
    "final_answer": "For ox DNA: \n\\( \\frac{A}{G} = 1.29 \\); \\( \\frac{T}{C} = 1.43 \\); \\( \\frac{A}{T} = 1.04 \\); \\( \\frac{G}{C} = 1.00 \\); \\( \\frac{(A + G)}{(T + C)} = 1.1 \\)\n\nWhat are the mole fractions of A, C, G, T? Before starting we should recognize that the data are inconsistent. For example,\n\n\\[\\frac{T}{C} \neq \\frac{A}{T} = \\frac{A}{C}\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\\frac{A}{G} \neq \\frac{G}{C}\\]\n\nso\n\n\\[\\frac{T}{G} \neq \\frac{A}{G} = \\frac{G}{C} \\]\n\nDoes \n\n\\[\\frac{T}{C} \\times \\frac{A}{T} = \\frac{A}{C}?\\]\n\n\\[\\frac{A}{C} \\times \\frac{T}{G} = 1.43 \\times 1.04 = 1.487\\]\n\\[\\frac{A}{G} \\times \\frac{G}{C} = 1.29 \\times 1.00 = 1.290\\]\n\nClearly, there are problems with the data. It is likely that the original data were concentrations of A, G, T and C and if we had these data it would be trivial to calculate the mole fractions of each. Using the data given, we could get several different answers depending on which of the ratios we used. Here is one possible answer.\n\nLet,\n\n\\[f_A + f_G + f_C + f_T = 1.0\\]\n\nwhere the terms are the mole fraction of each nucleotide.\n\n\\[f_A + f_G + f_T + f_C = 1.0\\]\n\nBut, \\(f_A = 1.04 \\, f_T\\) and \\(f_G = 1.0 \\, f_C\\) thus,\n\n\\[1.04 \\, f_T + 1.0 \\, f_C + f_T + f_C = 1.0, \\, \\text{or}\\]\n\\[2.04 \\, f_T + 2.0 \\, f_C = 1.0\\]\n\nBy substituting \\(f_T = 1.43 \\, f_C\\) we find that\n\n\\[2.04 \\times 1.43 \\, f_C + 2f_C = 1.0, \\, \\text{and}\\]\n\\[f_C = 0.20\\]\n\nAnd since\n\n\\[\\frac{G}{C} = 1.0, \\, f_G = 0.20\\]\n\\[f_A = 1.29 \\, f_G = 1.29 \\times 0.20\\]\n\\[f_A = 0.26\\]\n\nAnd, finally since\n\n\\[\\frac{T}{C} = 1.43,\\]\n\n\\[f_T = 1.43 \\times f_C = 1.43 \\times 0.20 = 0.29\\]\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[f_A = 0.26, \\, f_C = 0.20, \\, f_G = 0.20, \\, f_T = 0.29\\]\n\nThese are consistent with some of the data but not all of it. Below are other solutions you might come up with that are consistent with some of the data but not all of it:\n\n\\[\\begin{array}{cccc}\nA & C & G & T \\\\\n0.30 & 0.23 & 0.23 & 0.33 \\\\\n0.29 & 0.20 & 0.20 & 0.28 \\\\\n0.29 & 0.20 & 0.20 & 0.28 \\\\\n\\end{array}\\]\n\nBy treating the data as several equations in A, G, T and C one can come up with a solution that best fits all the data. Using A/G = 1.29, here is an example of one such equation:\n\n\\[-1.29G + 0^C + 0^T = 0\\]\n\nThe others are (from T/C = 1.43, A/T = 1.04), A/G = 1, A/G^C/T = 1.1 and A + T + C + G = 1.);\n\n\\[0^A + 0^G - 1.43C + T = 0\\]\n\\[A + 0^G + 0^C + 1.04T = 0\\]\n\\[A - G - 0^C + 0^T = 0\\]\n\\[A + G - 1.1C - 1.1T = 0\\]\n\\[A + G + C + T = 1.0\\]\n\nWe have six equations. What we want to do is find the best solutions for A, G, C and T that, when substituted into these equations, make them as consistent as possible. To do this we need to rearrange them such that they all are functions that equal zero. (The first five are already in this form. The fifth would be \\(A + G + C + T - 1 = 0\\)).\n\nWe then square each, sum them and then find solutions for A, G, C and T that minimize the sum of the squares. (In effect, this is a form of a least squares solution.) (The solution can be obtained using matrix algebra.) The answer is \\( A = .295, G = .223, C = .201 \\) and \\( T = .280 \\).\n\nAs an overkill, it must be that since the input data were A, G, T and C, some of the relationships presented in Table 10.1 are not truly independent. For example, the ratio of purines to pyrimidines must have been calculated with A, G, C, and T as input. If we eliminate this relationship from the analysis the answer is \\( A = .289, T = .286, G = .218 \\) and \\( C = .206 \\).",

Beyond these limits, the reaction rate decreases markedly. The enzyme is also rapidly inactivated at high ionic strength. You wish to assay the enzyme in the direction of lactate production. The reaction will be allowed to proceed until 0.05 M lactate is produced. In order to minimize inactivation of the enzyme you must use the lowest concentration of buffer possible that will still maintain the pH within the limits of 7.9 to 8.4. You decide to use Tris as a buffer.\n\nDescribe in detail the characteristics of your buffer; that is, indicate the starting pH of the assay mixture, the final pH, the concentrations of conjugate acid and conjugate base at the beginning and end of the reaction, and the total buffer concentration (conjugate acid plus conjugate base).

How varying the amount of enzyme or the addition of inhibitors affects v versus [S] plots\n\nUsing Figure 13.7 as a model, draw curves that would be obtained from v versus [S] plots when\na. twice as much enzyme is used.\nb. half as much enzyme is used.\nc. a competitive inhibitor is added.\nd. a pure noncompetitive inhibitor is added.\ne. an uncompetitive inhibitor is added.\nFor each example, indicate how V_{max} and K_{m} change.",

With twice as much enzyme the plot should asymptotically approach a value of V_{max} that is twice the value shown in the figure.

Half as much enzyme will reach a V_{max} value half that shown in Figure 13.7 but it will have the same K_{m}.\nc. A competitive inhibitor will not influence V_{max}, so the plot will asymptotically approach V_{max} but the K_{m} will be larger by a factor of (1 + [I]/K_i) where [I] is the inhibitor concentration and K_i is the dissociation constant for inhibitor binding to the enzyme.\nd. For a pure noncompetitive inhibitor, K_m will be unchanged but V_{max} will be lower by a factor of 1/(1 + [I]/K_i).\ne. For an uncompetitive inhibitor K_m will be decreased by the factor 1/(1 + [I]/K'_{i}) and V_{max} will be decreased by the same factor where K'_{i} is the inhibitor dissociation constant for binding to the enzyme/substrate complex.",

For the expected number of each genotype after one generation, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle.

    "final_answer": "Perhaps your immediate response is “16 map units,” but we are dealing not with single strands but with an entire meiosis. Since crossing over occurs at the four-strand stage, between two of the four strands, only half of 16 (or 8 percent) of the strands have undergone a crossover in the centromere–to–n–locus region. In order to keep map units in Neurospora tetrad analysis comparable to the units in most organisms, where only strand analysis is possible, this halving of the division 2 segregation frequency is necessary. The answer is 8 map units.",

    "question": "To prepare a genomic library, it is necessary to fragment the genome so that it can be cloned in a vector. A common method is to use a restriction nuclease.\n\na. How many different DNA fragments would you expect to obtain if you cleaved human genomic DNA with Sau3A (5′-GATC)? (Recall that there are \\(3.2 \\times 10^9\\) base pairs in the haploid human genome.) How many would you expect to get with EcoRI (5′-GAATTC)?\n\nb. Human genomic libraries are often made from fragments obtained by cleaving human DNA with Sau3A in such a way that the DNA is only partially digested; that is, so that not all the Sau3A sites have been cleaved. What is a possible reason for doing this?",
    "final_answer": "A. A restriction nuclease that recognizes a four-base-pair site will cut on average 1 out of 256 four-base-pair sites [(1/4)^4]. Thus, you would expect on the order of 1.3 × 10^7 fragments (3.2 × 10^9/256) from a Sau3A digestion of human DNA. Similarly, you would expect on the order of 7.8 × 10^5 fragments (3.2 × 10^9/4096) from an EcoRI digestion. These estimates are based on the assumptions that the genome is 50% GC and that the sequence is random: neither assumption is true, but they won’t lead you far astray. B. A set of overlapping DNA fragments will be generated by partial digestion. Libraries constructed from sets of overlapping fragments of a genome are valuable because they can be used to arrange cloned sequences in their original order on the chromosomes, and thus obtain the DNA sequence of a long stretch of DNA. Sequences from the end of the one cloned DNA are used as hybridization probes to find other clones in the library that contain those sequences and, therefore, might overlap. By repeating this procedure, a long stretch of continuous DNA sequence can be gradually built up. Overlapping clones were crucial in the original sequencing of the human genome.",

Regardless of the particulars of mitochondrial size and exact pHs, it is clear that only a few tens of protons are normally involved in establishing the proton-motive force.

A single cell in this culture acquires a mutation that allows it to divide with a generation time of only 15 minutes. Assuming that there is an unlimited food supply and no cell death, how long would it take before the progeny of the mutated cell became predominant in the culture? The number of cells \\(N\\) in the culture at time \\(t\\) is described by the equation \\(N = N_0 \\times 2^{t/G}\\), where \\(N_0\\) is the number of cells at zero time and \\(G\\) is the generation time. (Before you go through the calculation, make a guess: do you think it would take about a day, a week, a month, or a year?)",
    "final_answer": "It takes only 20 hours—less than a day—before the mutant cells become more abundant in the culture. From the equation provided in the question, the number of the original (“wild-type”) bacterial cells at time \\( t \\) minutes after the mutation occurred is \\( 10^6 \\times 2^{t/20} \\). The number of mutant cells at time \\( t \\) is \\( 1 \\times 2^{t/15} \\).

    "question": "When cells divide after mitosis, their surface area increases—a natural consequence of dividing a constant volume into two compartments. The increase in surface requires an increase in the amount of plasma membrane. One can estimate this increase by making certain assumptions about the geometry of cell division. Assuming that the parent cell and the two progeny cells are spherical, one can apply the familiar equations for the volume [(4/3)πr^3] and surface area (4πr^2) of a sphere.\n\nA. Assuming that the progeny cells are equal in size, calculate the increase in plasma membrane that accompanies cell division. (Although this problem can be solved algebraically, you may find it easier to substitute real numbers. For example, let the volume of the parent cell equal 1.) Do you think that the magnitude of this increase is likely to cause a problem for the cell? Explain your answer.\n\nB. During early development, many fertilized eggs undergo several rounds of cell division without any overall increase in total volume. For example, Xenopus eggs undergo 12 rounds of division before growth commences and the total cell volume increases. Assuming once again that all cells are spherical and equal in size, calculate the increase in plasma membrane that accompanies development of the early embryo, going from one large cell (the egg) to 4096 small cells (12 divisions).",
    "final_answer": "A. If the volume of the parental cell is 1, then the volume of each progeny cell is 0.5. (Note that it is not necessary to specify the units for the volume.)\n\nSince we are calculating a *fractional* increase in surface area, the units drop out at the end.) The radius of the parent cell can be calculated as follows\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{4\\pi r^3}{3} \\]\n\nSubstituting for \\( V = 1 \\) and rearranging\n\n\\[ r^3 = \\left( \\frac{3}{4\\pi} \\right) \\]\n\n\\[ r = \\left( \\frac{3}{4\\pi} \\right)^{\\frac{1}{3}} = 0.62 \\]\n\nThe surface area of the parental cell is\n\n\\[ A = 4\\pi r^2 \\]\n\nSubstituting for \\( r = 0.62 \\),\n\n\\[ A = 4.83 \\]\n\nThe same calculation for a progeny cell, using 0.5 as the volume, gives \\( r = 0.49 \\). The surface area of a single progeny cell is 3.02, and the surface area of both progeny cells is 6.04. The fractional increase in surface area due to division is\n\n\\[ \\text{Increase} = \\frac{(6.04 - 4.83)}{4.83} = 25\\% \\]\n\nThus, at cell division there is a 25% increase in the amount of plasma membrane. This increase is unlikely to cause the cell any problem. The internal pools of membrane in most cells are much greater than the plasma membrane and serve as a ready source of new plasma membrane.\n\nB. If there is a 25% increase in membrane at each cell division, then the total membrane area after a division is 1.25 times the membrane area before division. Thus, for 12 successive divisions with no increase in total cell volume, the total membrane area increases \\( (1.25)^{12} = 15 \\)-fold. This increase is much more substantial than in a single cell division and suggests that eggs must have an extra large internal supply of membrane or that plasma membrane synthesis keeps pace with cell division.",
