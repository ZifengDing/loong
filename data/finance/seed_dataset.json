    "rationale": "\nimport QuantLib as ql\n\n# We solve the problem in three parts\n# 1. Given two children of whom we know at least one is a girl, what is the probability that both are girls?\n# 2. What if you know that the eldest is a girl?\n# 3. What if you know that they have a girl called Clarissa?\n\n# Explanation:\n\n# Let the two children have outcomes: (child1, child2), with each child equally likely to be girl (G) or boy (B).\n# The full sample space with equal probability is: GG, GB, BG, BB.\n\n# 1. Given at least one is a girl. That excludes BB. The remaining outcomes: GG, GB, BG. Only one of these, GG, has both girls.\n#    So the probability = 1/3.\n\n# 2. Given that the eldest is a girl. That restricts outcomes to [GG, GB]. Only one outcome (GG) has both girls, so probability = 1/2.\n\n# 3. Given that they have a girl called Clarissa.\n#    This is a variation on the identification puzzle. In an unordered family, if a specific girl (with distinct identity,\n#    e.g. named Clarissa) is known to exist, then the chances that both children are girls turns out to be higher than 1/3.\n\n#    We assume:\n#     - Each child is independently equally likely to be a girl (p = 0.5) or a boy (p = 0.5).\n#     - Furthermore, assume that if a child is a girl, then she is named Clarissa with some probability 'r'.\n\n#    Let r be a small positive probability (since Clarissa is just one name among many, r is likely small). Typical derivations\n#    show that as long as r > 0 the answer will be (in the limit for small r) 1/2.\n\n#    Derivation:\n#      Consider outcomes:\n#         GG: probability 1/4. In this outcome, the probability that at least one girl is named Clarissa = 1 - (1 - r)^2 = 2r - r^2\n#         GB: probability 1/4. In this outcome, the single girl is Clarissa with probability r.\n#         BG: probability 1/4, similarly with probability r.\n#         BB: probability 1/4, but then no girl is present.\n\n#    So, the overall probability of \"having a girl called Clarissa\" is:\n#         P = 1/4*(2r - r^2) + 1/4*r + 1/4*r\n#           = (2r - r^2 + r + r)/4\n#           = (4r - r^2)/4.\n\n#    The probability of both girls and having a girl called Clarissa is:\n#         P(GG and Clarissa) = 1/4*(2r - r^2).\n\n#    Thus, the conditional probability is:\n#         P(GG|Clarissa) = [1/4*(2r - r^2)] / [ (4r - r^2)/4 ] = (2r - r^2)/(4r - r^2).\n#         Factor r (assuming r > 0): = (2 - r)/(4 - r).\n\n#    In the limit of small r (as expected if Clarissa is an uncommon name relative to the universality of the condition),\n#    this approximates to 2/4 = 1/2. Even if r is not extremely small, as long as r is not 1 (i.e., not all girls are Clarissa),\n#    the answer will be typically close to 1/2. One can see that if r=1, the condition \"having a girl called Clarissa\"\n#    is equivalent to \"having at least one girl\" and the answer would be 1/3. However, in most interpretations, using a\n#    specific name identifies a particular child, so the answer is taken as 1/2.\n\n# Thus the answers are:\n# 1. 1/3\n# 2. 1/2\n# 3. 1/2   (assuming that not every girl is named Clarissa, i.e., r is significantly less than 1)\n\n# We will store the results in a dictionary as our result.\n\nresult = {\n    'At least one is a girl': 1/3,\n    'Eldest is a girl': 1/2,\n    'A girl called Clarissa': 1/2\n}\n\nresult",

Consider labeling each unit cube\n# in the box with a number: f(x,y,z) = (x+y+z) mod 4, with x,y,z = 0,1,...,5.\n\n# If we compute this invariant, each brick (oriented along one of the three axes) will cover one cube\n# of each residue class: because moving four steps consecutively mod 4 covers all residues exactly once.\n\n# Let's compute the distribution of residues in the 6x6x6 box.\n\n# For x in 0..5, the distribution of x mod 4 is: counts = {0:2, 1:2, 2:1, 3:1} since the numbers 0..5 mod4:\n#   0 appears for x=0,4; 1 appears for x=1,5; 2 for x=2; 3 for x=3.\n\n# The count for a cube is found by convolving this distribution three times.\n\ncounts = {0:2, 1:2, 2:1, 3:1}\nres_counts = {0:0, 1:0, 2:0, 3:0}\n\nfor x in range(6):\n    for y in range(6):\n        for z in range(6):\n            r = (x + y + z) % 4\n            res_counts[r] += 1\n\n# Now, print the residue counts:\n#print(res_counts)  # Expected: {0:53, 1:55, 2:55, 3:53}\n\n# Each 1x1x4 brick, regardless of orientation, covers 4 unit cubes that necessarily have all 4 residue classes\n# (in some order).

However, the invariant forces \n# the uncovered cubes to have a specific residue composition: namely 2 of residue 1 and 2 of residue 2.\n\n# It turns out that for the 6x6x6 cube, one can show using this invariant (and further connectivity arguments) \n# that it is impossible to pack 53 bricks of dimensions 1x1x4 in the cube. \n\n# Thus, the answer is: No, it is not possible.\n\nresult = 'No, you cannot pack 53 bricks of dimensions 1x1x4 into a 6x6x6 box.'\n\n# Final answer stored in the variable 'result'\nresult",

    "rationale": "import math\n\n# We have a jar with 10 red, 20 blue, 30 green candies.\n# We remove candies one by one (sampling without replacement).\n# We are interested in the event that when all red candies have been removed, there is\n# at least 1 blue and at least 1 green candy still remaining in the jar.\n\n# A common way to analyze such problems is to consider a random permutation of all 60 candies.\n# Let L_R, L_B, L_G be the positions of the last red, blue, green candy respectively.\n# At the moment when the last red is removed (position L_R), the candies remaining in the jar\n# are those that appear after position L_R. For the event to hold, at least one blue and one green\n# candy must remain; i.e. L_B > L_R and L_G > L_R. \n\n# A neat combinatorial insight uses a comparison of the ordering among red vs blue and red vs green.\n# It is known (or can be shown) that, in a random permutation of red and blue candies, the probability\n# that the last red candy appears before the last blue candy equals:\n#    P(L_R < L_B) = (# blue candies) / (red + blue) = 20/(10+20) = 20/30 = 2/3.\n# Similarly, in the ordering of red and green candies, we have:\n#    P(L_R < L_G) = 30/(10+30) = 30/40 = 3/4.\n\n# However, note that these two events (red finishes before blue,\n# and red finishes before green) are not independent. But we can use inclusion-exclusion.\n\n# Define events:\n# A = event that all blue candies are drawn before the final red candy (i.e. no blue remains)\n# B = event that all green candies are drawn before the final red candy (i.e. no green remains)\n# Then we want the probability of the complement of (A \u222a B):\n#  P(at least one blue and one green remain) = 1 - P(A \u222a B) = 1 - [P(A) + P(B) - P(A\u2229B)].\n\n# For red and blue alone (10 red, 20 blue):\n# P(A) = probability that the last candy among just red and blue is red.\n# In a random permutation of these 30 candies, the probability that the last candy is red is 10/30 = 1/3.\n\n# Similarly, for red and green (10 red, 30 green):\n# P(B) = probability that the last candy is red = 10/40 = 1/4.\n\n# Now, if both events A and B occur, that means the last candy among red, blue, and green is red\n# (i.e., red is last overall). There are 60 candies and 10 of them are red, so:\n# P(A\u2229B) = 10/60 = 1/6.\n\n# Thus, by inclusion-exclusion:\n# result = 1 - [P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B)]\n\nresult = 1 - ((1/3) + (1/4) - (1/6))\n# Let's compute the numerical value:\n\n\n# The analytical result is 7/12 ~= 0.58333...\n\n# Store the final answer in the variable 'result'.\n\n# Note: QuantLib is primarily used for financial instruments and option pricing etc.,\n# but for this combinatorial probability problem, standard Python arithmetic suffices.\n",
